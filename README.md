# Vision-I: A Blind Assistance System

Vision-I is a vision enhancement module specifically designed for blind individuals. It allows blind users to utilize an application that sends real-time frames to a laptop-based wireless networked system. The system employs real-time object detection using the SSD_MOBILENET algorithm and TensorFlow APIs. Its core feature includes approximate distance calculation and voice-based wireless feedback generation based on the distance calculation. Vision-I aims to make the lives of blind individuals easier, more efficient, and reliable by providing wireless voice-based feedback regarding the proximity of objects, thereby enhancing their navigation experience. Additionally, the same system can be used for obstacle detection.

## Features
* Easy integration
* Voice activation
* Real-time interface
* Compatibility with Android mobile webcams

## Setup
To set up Vision-I, follow these steps:
1. Fork the repository to your profile.
2. Clone the repository to your local machine using Git.
3. Install dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. Follow the YouTube tutorial provided for further guidance.
5. Run the [MainFile] webcam_blind_voice.py to start using the system.

## TODO
There are some improvements and additional features planned for Vision-I:
* Make it dynamic over cloud systems for enhanced scalability and accessibility.
* Provide features to input the class of object for more precise feedback.

## :clap: And it's done!

Feel free to contribute to Vision-I and help make it even more accessible and user-friendly for blind individuals.
